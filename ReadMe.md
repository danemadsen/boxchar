# Boxchar
Boxchar is a simple header only library for creating text based user interfaces in C and C++. 
It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. At this stage, boxchar doesnt implement 
anywhere near as many features as ncurses.

Currently untested on windows so feedback would be appriciated

## Features
- Header-only: Easy to integrate with your project.
- Cross-platform: Compatible with Windows and Unix-like operating systems.
- Color support: Allows customization of text and background colors.
- Lightweight and fast: Built with performance in mind.
- UTF-8 and wide character support: For internationalization and localization.

## Prerequisites
- A C or C++ compiler.
- Basic knowledge of C or C++ programming.

## Installation
Since Boxchar is a header-only library, installation is as simple as copying `boxchar.h` into your project's include path. You can do this by adding it to your project manually or including it as a submodule in your git project.
